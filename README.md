# notes_on_bioinfo_basics

Here are some notes I made after my thesis project for future me and anyone who are interested in the basics of bioinformatics! :-D They are intended for someone with basic understanding of using bash and wish to learn more about some tricks / scripts that might be useful during the analysis. I would be very grateful if you can let me know if there are any mistakes so I can improve my skills with you! Asl happy to know if there is something I could add to make it more comprehensive.

Things planning to add:
- Bash, HPC, and Conda (1)
- Bulk RNA sequencing (in progress...）
- ChIP-Seq, ATAC-seq, Cut&Tag/Run (in progress...)
- Hi-C, Micro-C (in progress)

Section 1 (Bash) will be entirely on bash, but in later sections there might be some scripts from R as well.
